## Configuration

After installing the theme successfully, i recommend you to take a look at the [exampleSite](https://github.com/kishaningithub/hugo-shopping-product-catalogue-simple/tree/master/exampleSite) directory. You will find a working Hugo site configured with the theme that you can use as a starting point for your site.
